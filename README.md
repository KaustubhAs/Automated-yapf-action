# autoyapf
It is a GitHub action for yapf, an open-source tool that automatically formats Python code to conform to the PEP 8 style guide. It is in essence, the algorithm that takes the code and reformats it to the best formatting that conforms to the style guide, even if the original code didn't violate the style guide.
